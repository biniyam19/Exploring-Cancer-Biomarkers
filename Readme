1.Objectives

Objective of this task is to derive a cutoff of one of the features and to find a combination of potentially diagnostic variables for the identification of benign vs. malignant 
tumors.
2.Dataset

The dataset consists of 569 examples of breast cancer biopsies. Each example has 32 variables. Out of the 32 variables, 30 are continuous features(biomarkers), one is an 
identification number, and the other is diagnosis. The diagnosis outcome is coded as “M” to indicate the tumor is malignant and as “B” to indicate the tumor is benign.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Exploratory analysis was performed to describe the centrality, variability, and distributional behavior of the biomarkers. The mean was used as a measurement of central 
tendency, the standard deviation, range, and the coefficient of variation(CV) were used as measurements of variation, and skewness and kurtosis were used as measurements of
distribution shape. Also, as part of data exploration histogram of each biomarker by diagnosis (M vs. B) was visualized.
